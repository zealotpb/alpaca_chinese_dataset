Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney has spent the most on TV advertising so far among presidential contenders. The cost to try to influence the 2008 election could exceed $3 billion, according to TNS Media Intelligence/Campaign Media Analysis Group, CNN's consultant on political television advertising. This is nearly twice as much than what was spent in 2004 when political and issue-advocacy television advertising rang in at $1.7 billion. In 2006, $2.3 billion was spent on political and issue-advocacy TV commercials. Just about every candidate running for an office from dogcatcher to president is spending the money, said Evan Tracey, CMAG's chief operating officer. The costs to produce a TV commercial are no longer prohibitive for local and state candidates, who are turning more and more to the airwaves to reach voters. See how spending breaks down for this year \u00bb . And interest groups have spent $6.2 million on TV ads so far this year for state and local ballot measures. On the national level, the cost of issue-advocacy television ad spending was $270 million in the first nine months of this year. Subjects ranged from the Iraq war to telecommunications reform. Television ads on health care alone total $60 million. CMAG estimates more than $3 million of the $270 million spent to air issue-advocacy ads this year has gone for commercials in states and districts that are likely to have competitive House and Senate races in 2008. Tracey said he thinks this is just the beginning of interest groups \"pivoting from legislative advocacy mode to political mode.\" \"What we expect to see between now and the end of the primaries, and through the general election, is groups will take a more aggressive stance on their advertising and actually target candidates,\" he said. With 17 Democratic and Republican candidates running for president, CMAG predicts that more than $800 million will be spent on TV ads in the battle for the White House. Up to now, the political commercials have been largely focused on the early states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. Voters in some of the 20-plus states holding nominating contests on February 5 will start seeing ads in the coming months.", "output": "Political Ad Spending Reaches Record Highs in U.S. Presidential Election Cycle of 2008."}, {"instruction": "Given the following words, come up with a one-word synonym for each word:", "input": "engaged, evident", "output": "involved, apparent"}, {"instruction": "Describe a funny joke that is clean and appropriate for kids.", "input": "", "output": "Why did the chicken go to the s\u00e9ance?

This, coupled with training at the Acad\u00e9mie Humbert, helped Braque foster his skills in painting and sculpture. \n\nIn his earlier career, Braque focused mainly on Fauvism and Post-Impressionism. He developed an affinity for the latter due to its use of vibrant colors and distorted perspective. It was while exploring this latter style that he met Henri Matisse. From then onwards, Braque and Matisse created works of art together, which heavily influence the emergence of Cubism. Their styles, along with the use of multiple perspectives, were integrated together to form this new movement. These techniques have become integral to modern art to this day. \n\nBraque himself evolved the Cubism style through his experiments with still life painting, alongside his exploration into abstract art. After his death in 1963, France awarded Braque the National Order of Merit for his immense contribution to art and culture."}, {"instruction": "You are required to generate a story with a given beginning.\n\nBeginning:\n\nThe sun was setting, and the sky was filled with a golden and pink hue.", "input": "", "output": "As the sun continued to descend, people began to gather around to share stories and watch the beauty of the sky.

Thus, acid rain is more harmful to plants and animals, as it can erode their protective coverings and corrode their surfaces.

With relatively little cost and effort, data, materials, and even personnel can be exchanged between distant groups, across different time zones and cultures. This has opened opportunities for various industries as well as international collaborations\u2014and is a major contributing factor to technological and economic development. \n\nThe Internet also allows people to quickly connect with others they otherwise would not have had access to. This connection makes it possible to connect with potential customers and business partners, allowing them to further their own enterprises. It also helps create a sense of community and socializing, even with individuals around the world. With the prevalence of social media, users can easily find, connect and communicate with groups of people with similar interests and goals. \n\nThe Internet has made both learning and entertainment much more accessible. More and more materials, such as e books, podcasts and MOOCs, are becoming available every day. Moreover, with the improved range of communication, it is now possible to join online gaming sites and tournaments with people from around the world without having to physically travel to the respective city or country.\n\nThe undeniably growing influence of the Internet in modern society is undeniable.

It consists of four main stages which are prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. \n\nIn prophase, the chromosomes condense and the nuclear membrane begins to break down. Microtubules attach to each chromosome at their centromeres in order to form the mitotic spindle. \n\nIn metaphase, the chromosomes line up along the equatorial plane in the middle of the spindle. \n\nIn anaphase, the microtubules attached to each chromatid pull on the sister chromatids in opposite directions. This results in the separation of the chromatids and the movement of the chromosomes to the opposite poles of the spindle. \n\nIn telophase, the chromosomes move to the poles of the spindle. The nuclear membrane reforms and the chromatids begin to relax and decondense. Ultimately, cytoplasm splits and the cell is divided into two daughter cells that are identical to the parent cell. \n\nMitosis is an essential process for cell growth and the survival of single-celled organisms. It is also essential for tissue and organ growth and repair."}, {"instruction": "Answer the following question: What is the maximum speed limit in Arkansas?", "input": "", "output": "The maximum speed limit in Arkansas is 70 miles per hour."}, {"instruction": "Translate the text from Spanish to English.", "input": "Me gusta mucho hacer deportes", "output": "I really like to do sports."}, {"instruction": "Explain what a software engineer does.", "input": "", "output": "A software engineer is someone who designs, develops, tests, and maintains software products.

First, the US has removed itself from a global effort to reduce emissions of heat-trapping \"greenhouse\" gases, mainly from burning fossil fuels such as coal and oil. This means the US will be releasing more emissions and will not have any mandatory controls to reduce emissions. This in turn could lead to rapid increases in global temperatures and drastic climate change. In addition, the US withdrawal could disrupt the current momentum of global efforts to stop and possibly reverse global warming. This may lead to a situation where countries that remain committed to the Agreement could be less likely to adhere to the terms. Finally, weakness in US leadership in addressing climate change could result in greater economic and political power shifting to countries that are engaged in combatting climate change, such as China and India. While the US withdrawal will have a significant impact on the global environment, it is important to remain engaged in the global conversation on climate change in order to support and actively participate in solutions. That could include engaging in research and development of carbon-reducing technologies, participating in global summits and encouraging emissions-cutting initiatives. Additionally, it is important for citizens and local governments to continue to take action on climate change, regardless of the stance of their national government. This could include reducing energy consumption, supporting renewable energy initiatives, and advocating for stronger clean energy policies. Overall, the US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement has significant implications for climate change and global environmental policy.

The most notable benefit is the fuel efficiency they offer due to the utilization of both a gasoline engine and an electric motor. This efficient combination allows hybrid vehicles to produce up to twice the fuel economy of conventional heavy-duty vehicles, with some hybrids achieving up to 125 miles per gallon. In addition to fuel efficiency, hybrids have a lower environmental impact than gasoline-powered cars. They emit fewer pollutants, as they burn no gasoline while in operation. The electric motors of hybrids also produce less noise than gasoline engines, leading to a quieter ride.\n\nHybrid cars are also relatively inexpensive to maintain compared to traditional vehicles. They require less oil and fewer routine engine checks, which makes them less expensive to care for over the long run. Additionally, since most hybrid cars are equipped with regenerative braking, their brake pads and rotors last longer than those in gas-powered vehicles. Furthermore, hybrids often receive federal or local tax incentives or buyback programs from dealers, which can make them a more affordable option than other modes of transportation."}, {"instruction": "Explain how quantum computing works in two paragraphs.", "input": "", "output": "Quantum computing is the use of quantum-mechanical phenomena such as superposition and entanglement to perform computation. Compared to classical computing, quantum computing relies on the principles of quantum mechanics to store and process data in units of quantum states, instead of bits and bytes. This form of computing can process billions of calculations in parallel, representing a far more efficient form of computing. \n\nA quantum computer consists of quantum bits, also known as qubits. Unlike classical bits, which have a value of either 0 or 1, qubits can be in a state of 0, 1, or a superposition of both. This phenomenon allows a quantum computer to perform tasks that are impossible on a classical computer by utilizing principles such as entanglement, which connects qubits together across a quantum network, allowing them to be written and read simultaneously. With this, a quantum computer can solve complex problems that require immense computational power."}, {"instruction": "Compare and contrast democratic and authoritarian regimes in 4 sentences.", "input": "", "output": "Democratic regimes tend to promote individual liberty, citizen participation, and the rule of law, while authoritarian regimes emphasize hierarchy, obedience to higher authorities, and control over the population.
